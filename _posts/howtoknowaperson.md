This book helped me get through a hard time in my life. After losing someone special to me, I tried to understand my emotions and what it was that got me so down. Brooks explains it very well with his Illuminator analogy. Some people are so good at seeing who you are, it's like your heart is warmed in sunlight after a lifetime in darkness. This light makes you want to become the person that they know you can be. Losing this light was hard, but I realized that instead of trying to find another source of light, I would do my best to become it. He goes over basic strategies for making people feel seen, including asking smart questions. Everyone has gone through similar experiences like high school, so connecting on those points makes us realize we aren't very different at all. Overall this book was fantastic and I have started to read his older books.
