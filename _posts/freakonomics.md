This book is a surprisingly easy read and really got me thinking differently about the world. His most iconic research involves correlation between abortion and lower crime rates, which is definitely controversial to say the least. Among many other things, this book teaches us that the intersection between two different things (statistics and history), can lead to very interesting fields of study. I don't think anyone can be the next Steven Levitt.
