My dad encouraged me to read as many finance books as possible when growing up, at least when I'm young I have time on my side. After reading books like Zero to One and Rich Dad, Poor Dad, I decided to take on a challenge and learn from the father of investing himself, Benjamin Graham. For starters, this book is about 5 times thicker than the previously mentioned ones, but it's not too difficult of a read. I learned general tidbits here and there, but got an overall message that investing isn't what it used to be. Back in the 60s when Buffett was young, he would read the newspapers everyday to find information on stocks. He would do his own calculations to find companies that were undervalued based on their current price and their future earnings. He always said, "it's better to buy a great company at a good price than a good company at a great price." That's the secret to his wealth: the stock market didn't have instant calculations and predictions, and it certainly wasn't as popular as it is today. With all the computers these days, it's not possible to find a secret winner without blind luck. The days of Buffett and Grahams winning stocks are over, but that doesn't mean to not invest. With enough time and compound interest, anyone can become a millionaire.
